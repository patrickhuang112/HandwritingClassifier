	A little about software
</h3>
<p>
	Software, put simply, is not real. Think about it for a second. Have you ever seen software? Not the output, the actual <i> software itself</i>? 
	<br>
	Have you ever felt software, tasted it, touched it, heard it??
	<br>
	When you see programmers writing software, what does it look like they're really doing? Are the results of their work immediately apparent, as with carpenters, painters, and plumbers? Or do you get the impression they're just pressing buttons randomly because they hope a piece of cheese will appear in the wall dispenser the way it always used to back in the good old days?
	<br>
	Please come to the obvious conclusion that there is no such thing as woftware.  It is a mirage, an illusion, and the con artists who have foisted it on an unsuspecting public are some of the most successful swindlers in history.
