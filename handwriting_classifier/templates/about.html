</h3>
<p>
Software, put simply, <b><i>DOES NOT EXIST</i></b>. Think about it for a second. 
	<ul style="list-style-type:disc;">
		<li>Have you ever seen software? Not the output, the actual <i> software itself</i>? 
		<li>Have you ever felt software, tasted it, touched it, heard it??</li>
		<li>When you see programmers writing software, what does it look like they're really doing? Are the results of their work immediately apparent, as with carpenters, painters, and plumbers? Or do you get the impression they're just pressing buttons randomly because they hope a piece of cheese will appear in the wall dispenser the way it always used to back in the good old days?</li>
	</ul>
	Please come to the obvious conclusion that there is no such thing as software.  It is a mirage, an illusion, and the con artists who have foisted it on an unsuspecting public are some of the most successful swindlers in history.

<h3>
	What is our <i>"software"</i>?
</h3>
<p>
	There are two main components of GAPE:
	<ul style="list-style-type:disc;">
		<li>A comparer that can "accurately" determine whether two images of handwritten text were written by the same person or not.</li>
		<li>A word to text converter which can "accurately" convert an image of text to ascii text</li>
	</ul>
</p>


<p>
	We utilize two sorts of neural networks for the handwriting classification task. Neural networks are algorithms that recognize patterns within
	vast amounts of data inputs. Data inputed into the network is converted into numbers that the network is able to scan. The neural network looks
	for patterns in the numbers. The neural network matches these patters with predefined labels that correspond with each data point. Thus, the network
	begins "learning" about certain characteristics that each label have. At the end, the numerical patterns are translated into real-world data, such as
	images. "Neurons" in each layer are responsible for analyzing the data. To better understand how a neural network works, watch this <a href = "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aircAruvnKk">video</a> by 3Blue1Brown.
</p>

<p>
	The first network we used was a sequential deep neural network with four layers. This network accurately predicted
	whether two samples were written by the same person 96% of the time, but in practice we found it overfitted
	(memorized instead of learned from) the training data and was quite inaccurate with user-submitted images.
	Here is the training progress:

	</div>


</p>
<p>
	The second neural network is a convolutional neural network. A convolutional neural network is different because of
	its ability to interpret local information in an image. Neurons in a layer also do not connect with every other neuron in a different
	layer. Instead, neurons correspond with specific parts/section of images. The key advantages of a convolutional neural network
	to a simple feedforward neural network are:
<ul style="list-style-type:disc;">
	<li>A reduction in the number of parameters and neurons necessary</li>
	<li>Consideration of an area instead of single input, allowing for better analysis of text, video, audio etc.</li>
</ul>
In practice, the convolutional network was only slightly more accurate than the simple network with user-submitted images.
Overfitting was a still large problem with this network.

</p>

<p>The final neural network we settled on was a siamese neural network. The siamese network instead used two identical
	convolutional networks, one for each image, before merging the two convolutional networks into a sequential network.
	Siamese networks are useful for facial recognition, one-shot learning, and other comparison based tasks. Our network
	resulted in a 84% test accuracy with 3000 pieces of data over 50 epochs. With the size of the dataset, the network
	performed very well, much better than our other two overfitting networks.</p>
<br>
<p>Initially, we created a graphical user interface to easily test and demonstrate our neural network. However, we have now
	replaced the GUI with this website that enables the same functionalities on a wider range of devices. Since it now not
	available to the public, some screenshots are provided to showcase the GUI.
